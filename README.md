## Introduction

Credit card fraud detection is crucial in protecting consumers and financial institutions from financial losses. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict fraudulent transactions based on historical data.

## Features

- Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Simple and user-friendly web interface built with Flask.
- RESTful API endpoints for integration with other applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
    cd credit-card-fraud-detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
2. Enter the transaction details in the provided form.
3. Click the "Predict" button to see if the transaction is fraudulent or not.

### API Endpoints

You can use the following API endpoints to integrate with other applications:

- **Predict Transaction:**

    ```http
    POST /predict
    ```

    **Request Body:**

    ```json
    {
      "transaction_details": {
        "feature1": value1,
        "feature2": value2,
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

    **Response:**

    ```json
    {
      "prediction": "fraudulent" or "not fraudulent",
      "probability": 0.85
    }
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the machine learning model is not included in this repository due to size constraints. You can download a publicly available credit card fraud detection dataset from sources such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a pre-trained classifier. You can train your own model using the dataset and update the application accordingly.
